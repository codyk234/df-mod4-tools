Downloading a database of known has files is useful because it will enhnace searching for and eliminating known OS and application files.

It would not let me enter "Known Bad", it was either "Known" or "Notable". I selected "Known" as it was the closest option. I believe Autopsy has been updated since the book was produced so some of the options are different. This is useful because it will make it easier to find or eliminate evidence we have already observed.

WinHex is useful because it is a quick way to gather hash values for a file or part of a file. Using hash values is important because they can show if evidence has changed.

Bit shifting helps hide evidence. If you shift all bits of data in a file, they become unreadable. If you discover files have been hidden like this you would be able to recover the hidden evidence by trying to figure out how it was shifted and shift it back to it's original form. It is similar to cracking a code. This could be essential to proving a suspect committed a crime.
