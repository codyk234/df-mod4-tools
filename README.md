## Exercise 1

Downloading a database of known has files is useful because it will enhnace searching for and eliminating known OS and application files.

It would not let me enter "Known Bad", it was either "Known" or "Notable". I selected "Known" as it was the closest option. I believe Autopsy has been updated since the book was produced so some of the options are different. This is useful because it will make it easier to find or eliminate evidence we have already observed.

WinHex is useful because it is a quick way to gather hash values for a file or part of a file. Using hash values is important because they can show if evidence has changed.

Bit shifting helps hide evidence. If you shift all bits of data in a file, they become unreadable. If you discover files have been hidden like this you would be able to recover the hidden evidence by trying to figure out how it was shifted and shift it back to it's original form. It is similar to cracking a code. This could be essential to proving a suspect committed a crime.

## Exercise 5
I could not figure out how to get Excercise 5 to work. I found a lot of information on Rainbow Tables, but all of it included using other software and doing downloads I was not sure were safe. I could not figure out how to create a Rainbow Table in Autopsy. I believe it has something to do with creating HashDatabse, but could not figure out how to create a hashdatabase that would even work for password cracking. I colaborated with my classmates and we were all having the same issue. ChatGPT advised that it would not help me with Rainbow Tables because they can be used for illegal password cracking. I look forward to finding out the solution to this.
